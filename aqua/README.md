## Aqua Theme for Bludit
### Full page navigation with large fonts

**Use the 'Aqua Theme Colors' plugin to customize your theme colors.**

The plugin can be downloaded from [Aquafortis on Github](https://github.com/Aquafortis/aqua-theme-colors)

To change the header image, just replace the header.jpg in the images folder with your own image using the same name.

To change your theme colors, simply type in a 6 digit hex code. Example #2D9BC0 or #2d9bc0

Change the header text color to suite your background image.

Change the Primary color to anything you like.

Use a darker color for your Secondary color. This will be the nav background, text and buttons hover colors.
